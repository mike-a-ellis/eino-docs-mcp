# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Full document retrieval over snippets — users need complete context
- LLM-generated metadata for better summaries and entity extraction
- Embedded Qdrant with persistent volume — no external DB dependency
- Periodic sync over webhooks — simpler implementation, docs change infrequently

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Research Insights:**
- Qdrant has no embedded Go mode — must run as separate service (Docker sidecar on Fly.io)
- MCP authentication should be implemented in Phase 1, not deferred (security best practice)
- Fly.io volumes are NOT automatically replicated — need snapshot configuration
- Embedding drift risk — partial re-indexing can degrade retrieval quality

None blocking current work. All flagged for consideration during planning.
